This template was published as part of my Front-end development programme.
Here, I used github to publish a website template which was downloaded off the web- see below.
As I have already learnt Bootstrap, it would now be easy for me to put my website online for others to see and appreciate. I have also seen different examples of website templates with exiting design ideas which I can use for any website I plan to build in the future.


Thanks for downloading this template!
